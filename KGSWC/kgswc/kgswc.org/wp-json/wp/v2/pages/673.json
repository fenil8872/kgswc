Semantic technologies focus on adding meaning and context to data, allowing machines to understand and interpret information more effectively. When applied to IoT, this concept aims to enhance the interoperability, understanding, and usability of devices, services, and data within the IoT landscape. Semantic IoT is an evolving field that bridges the gap between the physical world of IoT devices and the digital realm of semantic technologies. As more domains and industries recognize the potential of this approach, we can expect further innovations and applications that leverage the power of semantics to create smarter, more interconnected systems. The evolution of semantic IoT technologies emerged to the intersection of semantic IoT with AI, machine learning and many other areas.<\/p><p><strong><br><\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Topics of interests:<\/strong><br><\/p><p>-Semantic Reasoning and Decision-Making<\/p><p>-Data Interoperability and Integration<\/p><p>-Context-Awareness and Ambient Intelligence in IoT<\/p><p>-Semantic Stream Processing<\/p><p>-Privacy and security relevant to intelligent systems in IoT<\/p><p>-IoT systems and architectures for data acquisition, storage, and processing<\/p><p>-Semantic AI in IoT<\/p><p>-Semantic-Enhanced IoT Applications<\/p><p>-Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives on Semantic IoT<\/p><p><strong><br><\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Workshop Chairs<\/strong><\/p><p>-Fatima Zahra AMARA, University of Abbes Laghrour, Khenchela<\/p><p>-Mounir HEMAM, University of Abbes Laghrour, Khenchela<\/p><p><strong><br><\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Submission<\/strong>:<\/p><p>We welcome the following types of contributions:<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Full research papers (10-15 pages): Finished or consolidated R&amp;D works, to be included in one of the Workshop topics<\/p><p>Short papers (4-6 pages): Ongoing works with relevant preliminary results, opened to discussion.<\/p><p>At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop, in order to present the paper, there, and to the conference.
